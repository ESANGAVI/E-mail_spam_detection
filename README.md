**Email Spam Detection**
This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham (not spam). It includes text cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, model training, evaluation, and performance visualization.

**Features**
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, cleaning, removing special characters)
- Models: Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- Visualizations: ROC Curve, Probability Distribution, Message Length Analysis

**Tech Stack**
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

**Project Structure**
spam_detection.py / spam_detection.ipynb  
spam.csv  
README.md

**How to Run**
1. Install dependencies: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib  
2. Run the script or notebook  
3. Load the dataset and execute all steps to train and evaluate the model

**Result**
The model accurately classifies emails as spam or ham and provides visual insights into classification performance.
